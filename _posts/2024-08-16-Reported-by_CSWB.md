  Recently, the development in complex reber welding was reported by a famous social media, Changsha Wanbao. This technology aims at using Yolov9 for target identification and segmentation of complex rebar cage joints, processing point cloud data, predicting the actual 6DOF welding pose based on scene point cloud data. In the future, we will also adopt an end-to-end method to address this problem. Moreover, we have established an automated welding workstation for further research.
