## Using an incident response playbook to handle a phishing attack

**Scenerio:**

You are a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, you received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. 
After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that you have this information, you must follow your organization's process to complete your investigation
and resolve the alert.

This incident response begins with recieving an alert ticket which indicates a potential phising attempt. I procceded to analyze the ticket.
