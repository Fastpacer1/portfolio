You were hired as a SOC Analyst for one of the biggest Juice Shops in the world and an attacker has made their way into your network. 

Your tasks are:

* Figure out what techniques and tools the attacker used
* What endpoints were vulnerable
* What sensitive data was accessed and stolen from the environment

An IT team has sent you a zip file containing logs from the server.
